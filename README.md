Phantom
=======

Create the illusion of code-free database persistence.

Introduction
-------------

Phantom leverages MEF and Entity Framework's DbContext to persist your POCO classes to a database without the need to define DbSet objects. It is less of a library and more of a pattern/example. 


Possible Usages
----------------

Phantom can be used for any database persistence, but it was designed to work with extensions.
